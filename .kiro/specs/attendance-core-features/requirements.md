# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the core attendance functionality for the attendance microservice, building upon the foundation established in phases 1-2. This includes daily attendance tracking with clock-in/out functionality, field worker location logging, user-specific entity assignments, and reporting capabilities for managers. The system will validate locations using geospatial calculations, detect potential fraud through travel speed analysis, and provide comprehensive reporting for team management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Daily Attendance Management

**User Story:** As an employee, I want to clock-in and clock-out for my daily attendance so that my work hours are accurately tracked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN an employee clocks-in THEN the system SHALL record the timestamp, GPS coordinates, and associated entity
3. WHEN an employee attempts to clock-in multiple times on the same date THEN the system SHALL reject the request with appropriate error message
4. WHEN an employee attempts to clock-out without clocking-in THEN the system SHALL reject the request
5. WHEN an employee clocks-out THEN the system SHALL calculate total work hours and travel speed from clock-in location
6. IF travel speed exceeds 200 km/h THEN the system SHALL flag the attendance record for review
7. WHEN attendance is flagged THEN the system SHALL mark is_flagged as true and log the reason

### Requirement 2: Location Validation and Geospatial Processing

**User Story:** As the system, I want to validate employee locations against authorized entities so that attendance can only be recorded at valid work locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an employee submits location coordinates THEN the system SHALL find the nearest authorized entity within search radius
2. WHEN calculating distance THEN the system SHALL use the Haversine formula for accurate geospatial calculations
3. IF employee location is within entity radius THEN the system SHALL mark is_within_radius as true
4. IF employee location is outside all authorized entity radii THEN the system SHALL reject the attendance request
5. WHEN determining authorized entities THEN the system SHALL check user-specific assignments first, then department assignments
6. WHEN no authorized entities are found THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error message with nearest available entities

### Requirement 3: Session Management (Breaks and Temporary Leaves)

**User Story:** As an employee, I want to check-in and check-out multiple times during my workday for breaks, meetings, and errands so that my presence at the workplace is accurately tracked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an employee attempts session check-in THEN the system SHALL require an active daily attendance record
2. WHEN an employee session checks-in THEN the system SHALL record timestamp, coordinates, and session type
3. WHEN an employee has an active session check-in THEN the system SHALL prevent new session check-ins until check-out
4. WHEN an employee session checks-out THEN the system SHALL calculate session duration and travel speed
5. WHEN calculating travel speed between sessions THEN the system SHALL flag speeds exceeding 200 km/h
6. WHEN an employee session checks-in THEN the system SHALL validate location is within the entity radius
7. IF session location is outside entity radius THEN the system SHALL reject the session check-in request
8. WHEN creating session records THEN the system SHALL support session types: work, break, lunch, meeting, errand

### Requirement 4: Field Worker Location Logging

**User Story:** As a field worker, I want to check-in and check-out at multiple client sites during my workday so that my visits are tracked for billing and reporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a field worker attempts location check-in THEN the system SHALL require an active daily attendance record
2. WHEN a field worker checks-in to a location THEN the system SHALL record timestamp, coordinates, entity, and purpose
3. WHEN a field worker has an active location check-in THEN the system SHALL prevent new check-ins until check-out
4. WHEN a field worker checks-out THEN the system SHALL calculate visit duration and travel speed to next location
5. WHEN calculating travel speed between locations THEN the system SHALL flag speeds exceeding 200 km/h
6. WHEN a field worker checks-in THEN the system SHALL validate location is within the specified entity radius
7. IF location is outside entity radius THEN the system SHALL reject the check-in request

### Requirement 5: User-Specific Entity Assignments

**User Story:** As a system admin, I want to assign specific entities to individual users so that certain employees can access locations beyond their department assignments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assigning entities to users THEN the system SHALL allow multiple entities per user
2. WHEN assigning entities to users THEN the system SHALL allow marking one entity as primary
3. WHEN determining authorized entities for attendance THEN the system SHALL prioritize user-specific assignments over department assignments
4. WHEN a user has both user-specific and department assignments THEN the system SHALL combine both sets of authorized entities
5. WHEN removing user-entity assignments THEN the system SHALL preserve historical attendance records
6. WHEN creating user-entity assignments THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate assignments for the same user-entity pair

### Requirement 6: Reporting and Manager Access

**User Story:** As a manager, I want to view attendance reports for my team members so that I can monitor attendance patterns and identify issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a manager requests team attendance THEN the system SHALL return data only for their direct reports
2. WHEN generating attendance reports THEN the system SHALL include clock-in/out times, total hours, and attendance status
3. WHEN displaying team attendance THEN the system SHALL show summary statistics (present, absent, late)
4. WHEN a manager views attendance details THEN the system SHALL include location information and any flagged records
5. WHEN filtering attendance reports THEN the system SHALL support date ranges and individual team member selection
6. WHEN attendance records are flagged THEN the system SHALL highlight them in manager reports
7. WHEN calculating attendance statistics THEN the system SHALL handle partial days and missing clock-outs appropriately

### Requirement 7: Fraud Detection and Data Integrity

**User Story:** As the system, I want to detect potentially fraudulent attendance records so that data integrity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating travel speed between locations THEN the system SHALL flag records exceeding 200 km/h
2. WHEN location coordinates are outside entity radius THEN the system SHALL either reject or flag the record based on configuration
3. WHEN detecting impossible travel times THEN the system SHALL flag the attendance record and log details
4. WHEN flagging records THEN the system SHALL preserve original data and add flag reason
5. WHEN multiple suspicious activities are detected THEN the system SHALL escalate the flag priority
6. WHEN flagged records exist THEN the system SHALL notify managers through the reporting interface

### Requirement 8: Reporting Structure Management

**User Story:** As a system admin, I want to define reporting relationships between employees and managers so that managers can access their team's attendance data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating reporting relationships THEN the system SHALL support start and end dates for time-bound relationships
2. WHEN an employee has multiple managers THEN the system SHALL support overlapping reporting periods
3. WHEN a manager is removed THEN the system SHALL preserve historical reporting relationships
4. WHEN determining team members THEN the system SHALL use active reporting relationships based on current date
5. WHEN reporting relationships change THEN the system SHALL immediately update manager access permissions
6. WHEN creating circular reporting relationships THEN the system SHALL prevent and reject such assignments

### Requirement 9: Data Consistency and Performance
