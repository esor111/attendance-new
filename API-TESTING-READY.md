# 🚀 API Testing - Ready to Execute!

## ⚡ **IMMEDIATE TESTING - 3 Simple Options**

### **Option 1: One-Command Testing (Recommended)**

#### **Windows:**
```bash
# Double-click or run in terminal
test-everything.bat
```

#### **Linux/Mac:**
```bash
# Make executable and run
chmod +x test-everything.sh
./test-everything.sh
```

### **Option 2: Direct Node.js Testing**
```bash
# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install axios colors

npm run start:dev

# Run tests (in another terminal)
node test-apis-now.js
```

### **Option 3: Manual Step-by-Step**
```bash
# 1. Start server
npm run start:dev

# 2. Test specific endpoints
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/requests
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/requests/leave -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"type":"LEAVE","requestData":{"leaveType":"ANNUAL","startDate":"2025-12-20","endDate":"2025-12-22","daysRequested":3,"reason":"Test"}}'
```

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Common Issues & Quick Fixes**

#### **❌ Server Not Running**
```bash
# Fix: Start your server
npm run start:dev
# or
npm start
```

#### **❌ Port Already in Use**
```bash
# Fix: Kill process on port 3000
npx kill-port 3000
# Then restart server
npm run start:dev
```

#### **❌ Database Connection Error**
```bash
# Fix: Start your database
# PostgreSQL: pg_ctl start
# Docker: docker-compose up -d postgres
```

#### **❌ Migration Issues**
```bash
# Fix: Run migrations
npm run migration:run
# or
npm run typeorm migration:run
```

#### **❌ Authentication Fails**
- The test script uses mock authentication if real auth fails
- Tests will continue to validate API structure
- Check if your auth endpoints are configured correctly

#### **❌ Module Not Found**
```bash
# Fix: Install dependencies
npm install axios colors
```
