## 🎉 Mission Accomplished!

The reporting structure (team/manager hierarchy) has been **completely removed** from the codebase. All services now use **RBAC only** for authorization.

---

## ✅ What Was Removed

### Files Deleted (2):
```
✅ src/modules/attendance/entities/reporting-structure.entity.ts
✅ src/modules/attendance/repositories/reporting-structure.repository.ts
```

### Services Cleaned (5):
```
✅ AttendanceService - Removed team methods
✅ RequestService - Simplified approval logic
✅ LeaveService - Removed team methods
✅ RemoteWorkService - Removed team methods
✅ AttendanceRequestService - Simplified approval logic
```

### Controllers Updated (1):
```
✅ AttendanceController - Removed team endpoints
```

### Modules Updated (2):
```
✅ attendance.module.ts - Removed registrations
✅ index.ts - Removed exports
```

## 📊 Detailed Changes

### 1. AttendanceService
- ❌ Removed `getTeamAttendance()` method
- ❌ Removed `getTeamMemberAttendance()` method
- ❌ Removed `reportingStructureRepository` dependency

### 2. AttendanceController
- ❌ Removed `GET /api/attendance/team` endpoint
- ❌ Removed `GET /api/attendance/team/:employeeId` endpoint

### 3. RequestService
- ✏️ Simplified `canApproveRequest()` - returns true (RBAC handles it)
- ✏️ Simplified `validateRequestAccess()` - owner only
- ✏️ Simplified `sendApprovalNotification()` - no manager lookup
- ❌ Removed `reportingStructureRepository` dependency

### 4. LeaveService
- ❌ Removed `getTeamLeaveRequests()` method
- ❌ Removed `getPendingTeamRequests()` method
- ✏️ Simplified `canApproveRequest()` - returns true (RBAC handles it)
- ✏️ Simplified `validateRequestAccess()` - owner only
- ✏️ Simplified `sendApprovalNotification()` - no manager lookup
- ❌ Removed `reportingStructureRepository` dependency

### 5. RemoteWorkService
- ❌ Removed `getTeamRequests()` method
- ❌ Removed `getPendingTeamRequests()` method
- ✏️ Simplified `approveRequest()` - no hierarchy check
- ❌ Removed `reportingStructureRepository` dependency

### 6. AttendanceRequestService
- ✏️ Simplified `approveRequest()` - no hierarchy check
- ❌ Removed `reportingStructureRepository` dependency

## 🎯 Authorization Model

### Before (Complex):
```typescript
// Two-layer authorization
@RequirePermissions('LEAVE:APPROVE:TEAM')  // Layer 1: RBAC
async approveLeave() {
  // Layer 2: Hierarchy check
  const isManager = await reportingStructureRepository.existsRelationship(...);
  if (!isManager) throw new ForbiddenException();
}
```

### After (Simple):
```typescript
// Single-layer authorization
@RequirePermissions('LEAVE:APPROVE:ALL')  // RBAC only
async approveLeave() {
  // No hierarchy check needed
  // If user has permission, they can approve
}
```

## 📝 What This Means

### Features Removed:
- ❌ Team viewing (manager sees team attendance)
- ❌ Team requests (manager sees team requests)
- ❌ Manager-specific approvals
- ❌ Reporting chains
- ❌ Manager notifications

### Features Kept:
- ✅ Individual user operations
- ✅ RBAC-based permissions
- ✅ Admin can manage all (with proper permissions)
- ✅ Users can manage their own data

### Authorization:
- ✅ RBAC handles ALL permissions
- ✅ No team/manager hierarchy
- ✅ Simpler, clearer model

---

## 🔍 Verification

### No Broken Imports:
```bash
grep -r "ReportingStructureRepository" src/
# Result: No matches ✅
```

### No Team Methods:
```bash
grep -r "getTeamAttendance\|getTeamRequests" src/
# Result: No matches ✅
```

### Simplified Approval:
```bash
grep -r "existsRelationship\|getReportingChain" src/
# Result: No matches ✅
```

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

1. **Simpler Codebase**
   - No complex hierarchy management
   - Single authorization model (RBAC)
   - Fewer files to maintain

2. **Clearer Logic**
   - One place for permissions (RBAC)
   - No mixed authorization models
   - Easier to understand

3. **Faster Development**
   - No team features to maintain
   - No hierarchy to manage
   - Focus on core functionality

4. **Better Separation**
   - RBAC handles permissions
   - Services handle business logic
   - Clear responsibilities

## 🚀 Next Steps

### If You Need Team Features Later:

**Option 1: Add Simple managerId Field**
```typescript
// User entity
@Column({ type: 'uuid', nullable: true })
managerId?: string;

// Check in controller
if (employee.managerId !== user.id) {
  throw new ForbiddenException();
}
```

**Option 2: Restore from Git**
```bash
git checkout 141acb0~1 -- src/modules/attendance/entities/reporting-structure.entity.ts
git checkout 141acb0~1 -- src/modules/attendance/repositories/reporting-structure.repository.ts
```
