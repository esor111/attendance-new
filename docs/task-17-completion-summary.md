# Task 17 Completion Summary: Consolidate Request Tables

## Overview

Task 17 has been successfully implemented to consolidate the 3 separate request tables (AttendanceRequest, RemoteWorkRequest, LeaveRequest) into a single unified Request system. This eliminates duplicate approval workflows and reduces maintenance overhead.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Unified Request Entity (`src/modules/attendance/entities/request.entity.ts`)

**Key Features:**
- Single table `requests` to replace 3 separate tables
- `RequestType` enum to distinguish request types: `LEAVE`, `REMOTE_WORK`, `ATTENDANCE_CORRECTION`
- JSON `requestData` column for type-specific data
- Common approval fields: `status`, `approverId`, `approvedAt`, `approvalNotes`, `rejectionReason`
- Type guard methods for type-safe access to request data
- Helper methods for display names and business logic

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE requests (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  type ENUM('LEAVE', 'REMOTE_WORK', 'ATTENDANCE_CORRECTION') NOT NULL,
  request_data JSON NOT NULL,
  status ENUM('PENDING', 'APPROVED', 'REJECTED', 'CANCELLED') DEFAULT 'PENDING',
  approver_id UUID,
  approved_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  approval_notes TEXT,
  rejection_reason TEXT,
  requested_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
  notes TEXT,
  created_attendance_id UUID,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 2. Unified Request Repository (`src/modules/attendance/repositories/request.repository.ts`)

**Key Features:**
- Generic CRUD operations for all request types
- Type-specific filtering and querying
- Manager approval workflows
- Team request management
- Request statistics and analytics
- Overlapping request detection (for leave requests)
- Date-based filtering with type-specific logic

### 3. Unified Request Service (`src/modules/attendance/services/request.service.ts`)

**Key Features:**
- Consolidated business logic for all request types
- Type-specific validation rules
- Generic approval workflow that adapts based on request type
- Automatic balance management for leave requests
- Weekly limit validation for remote work requests
- Attendance record creation for attendance correction requests
- Unified notification system

### 4. Unified Request Controller (`src/modules/attendance/controllers/request.controller.ts`)

**Key Features:**
- RESTful API endpoints for all request types
- Type-specific endpoints for convenience (`/leave`, `/remote-work`, `/attendance-correction`)
- Generic endpoints with type parameter (`/requests?type=LEAVE`)
- Unified approval workflow
- Request statistics and analytics
- Validation endpoints

**API Endpoints:**
```
POST   /api/requests                    - Create any type of request
POST   /api/requests/leave             - Create leave request
POST   /api/requests/remote-work       - Create remote work request  
POST   /api/requests/attendance-correction - Create attendance correction request
GET    /api/requests                   - Get user requests (with filtering)
GET    /api/requests/type/:type        - Get requests by specific type
GET    /api/requests/:id               - Get specific request
GET    /api/requests/pending/approval  - Get pending requests for manager
GET    /api/requests/team/all          - Get team requests for managers
POST   /api/requests/:id/approve       - Approve/reject request
POST   /api/requests/:id/cancel        - Cancel request
DELETE /api/requests/:id               - Delete request
GET    /api/requests/stats/summary     - Get request statistics
POST   /api/requests/validate          - Validate request creation
```

### 5. Unified DTOs (`src/modules/attendance/dto/`)

**Key Features:**
- Discriminated union DTOs based on request type
- Type-specific validation rules
- Unified approval DTO
- Backward compatibility with legacy DTOs (marked as deprecated)

### 6. Data Migration System

**Migration Service (`src/modules/attendance/migrations/consolidate-requests-migration.ts`):**
- Preserves all existing data during consolidation
- Maps status fields between different request types
- Validates data integrity after migration
- Provides rollback capability
- Transaction-based migration for data safety

**Migration Controller (`src/modules/attendance/controllers/migration.controller.ts`):**
- Admin endpoints to execute migration
- Migration status monitoring
- Rollback functionality for emergency scenarios

### 7. Comprehensive Testing

**Test Coverage (`src/modules/attendance/services/request.service.spec.ts`):**
- Unit tests for all request types
- Validation logic testing
- Approval workflow testing
- Error handling scenarios
- Type-specific business logic testing

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Database Simplification
- **Reduced Tables:** 3 tables → 1 table (67% reduction)
- **Eliminated Duplicate Schemas:** Common approval fields consolidated
- **Simplified Relationships:** Single entity relationships instead of multiple

### 2. Code Consolidation
- **Unified Service:** 3 services → 1 service with type-specific logic
- **Consolidated Repository:** Generic CRUD operations for all types
- **Single Controller:** Unified API with type-based routing
- **Reduced DTOs:** Discriminated unions instead of separate DTOs

### 3. Maintenance Benefits
- **Single Approval Workflow:** One workflow handles all request types
- **Consistent Validation:** Unified validation patterns
- **Easier Testing:** Single service to test instead of three
- **Simplified Deployment:** Fewer components to manage

### 4. Feature Parity

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Implementation (Completed)
- ✅ Created unified Request entity
- ✅ Implemented RequestRepository with generic operations
- ✅ Built RequestService with type-specific business logic
- ✅ Created RequestController with unified API
- ✅ Developed migration system with data preservation

### Phase 2: Data Migration (Ready to Execute)
- Execute migration using `/api/migration/consolidate-requests`
- Validate data integrity using `/api/migration/consolidate-requests/status`
- Monitor migration progress and handle any issues

### Phase 3: Legacy Cleanup (Future)
- Remove old request entities after successful migration
- Remove old services and repositories
- Remove old controllers and endpoints
- Update documentation and API references

## Technical Considerations

### Data Integrity
- All existing data is preserved during migration
- Foreign key relationships maintained
- Audit trail preserved with original timestamps
- Rollback capability available if needed

### Performance Impact
- JSON queries are optimized with proper indexing
- Type-specific indexes for efficient filtering
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Caching strategies can be applied uniformly

### Backward Compatibility
- Legacy DTOs marked as deprecated but still functional
- Migration can be executed without downtime
- Gradual transition possible with feature flags

## Validation and Testing

### Data Migration Validation
```typescript
// Check migration status
GET /api/migration/consolidate-requests/status

// Expected response:
{
  "originalCounts": {
    "attendanceRequests": 150,
    "remoteWorkRequests": 75, 
    "leaveRequests": 200,
    "total": 425
  },
  "migratedCounts": {
    "attendanceRequests": 150,
    "remoteWorkRequests": 75,
    "leaveRequests": 200, 
    "total": 425
  },
  "migrationComplete": true
}
```

### API Testing
```bash
# Test unified request creation
curl -X POST /api/requests/leave \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "LEAVE",
    "requestData": {
      "leaveType": "ANNUAL",
      "startDate": "2025-10-15",
      "endDate": "2025-10-17",
      "daysRequested": 3,
      "reason": "Family vacation"
    }
  }'

# Test request approval
curl -X POST /api/requests/{id}/approve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "APPROVED",
    "notes": "Approved for vacation"
