# Task 2 Completion Summary: User and Department Entities with Relationships

## Overview
Successfully implemented User and Department entities extending BaseEntity with proper relationships, validation decorators, and database constraints as required by the specifications.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. User Entity (`src/modules/user/entities/user.entity.ts`)
- **Extended BaseEntity**: Inherits UUID primary key and timestamp fields
- **Required Fields with Validation**:
  - `name`: String with length validation (1-255 characters)
  - `email`: Email validation with uniqueness constraint
  - `phone`: String validation with uniqueness constraint (1-20 characters)
  - `isFieldWorker`: Boolean validation
- **Optional Fields**:
  - `address`: Text field for user address
  - `userId`: External microservice ID for handshake process
  - `departmentId`: UUID reference to department
  - `lastSyncedAt`: Timestamp for external service sync tracking
- **Relationships**:
  - `department`: ManyToOne relationship with Department entity (nullable, SET NULL on delete)

### 2. Department Entity (`src/modules/department/entities/department.entity.ts`)
- **Extended BaseEntity**: Inherits UUID primary key and timestamp fields
- **Required Fields with Validation**:
  - `name`: String with length validation (1-100 characters)
  - `businessId`: UUID validation for external business reference
- **Unique Constraint**: Department name must be unique within each business (`@Unique(['name', 'businessId'])`)
- **Relationships**:
  - `users`: OneToMany relationship with User entities
  - `entityAssignments`: OneToMany relationship with DepartmentEntityAssignment entities

### 3. Database Constraints and Foreign Keys
- **User Table**:
  - Unique constraints on `email` and `phone` fields
  - Foreign key to `departments` table with SET NULL on delete
- **Department Table**:
  - Composite unique constraint on `name` + `businessId`
  - Proper foreign key relationships established

### 4. Validation Decorators
Added comprehensive validation decorators for use with NestJS validation pipes:
- `@IsString()`, `@Length()` for string fields
- `@IsEmail()` for email validation
- `@IsUUID()` for UUID fields
- `@IsBoolean()` for boolean fields
- `@IsOptional()` for nullable fields

### 5. Test Coverage
Created comprehensive test suites for both entities:
- **User Entity Tests**: Entity structure, relationships, BaseEntity inheritance
- **Department Entity Tests**: Entity structure, relationships, business logic requirements
- All tests passing with proper validation of entity behavior

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 4.1 - User Profile Management
✅ User entity with proper validation for email uniqueness across business
✅ Phone uniqueness validation implemented
✅ Department relationship with proper foreign key constraints

### Requirement 4.2 - User Profile Updates
✅ Validation decorators in place for email and phone uniqueness
✅ isFieldWorker status field with boolean validation
✅ Department assignment validation support

### Requirement 4.3 - User-Department Relationships
✅ ManyToOne relationship from User to Department
✅ OneToMany relationship from Department to Users
✅ Proper foreign key constraints with SET NULL on delete

### Requirement 3.1 - Department Creation
✅ Department entity with name and businessId validation
✅ Proper UUID generation through BaseEntity extension

### Requirement 3.2 - Department Name Uniqueness
✅ Composite unique constraint ensuring department names are unique within each business
✅ Database-level constraint enforcement

### Requirement 3.3 - Department Relationships
✅ OneToMany relationship with Users
✅ OneToMany relationship with DepartmentEntityAssignments
✅ Proper relationship handling for business data

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
- Both entities properly extend BaseEntity for consistent UUID and timestamp management
- Foreign key relationships established with appropriate cascade options
- Unique constraints implemented at database level for data integrity

### Validation Strategy
- Class-validator decorators applied for runtime validation through NestJS pipes
- Database constraints provide additional data integrity layer
- Proper handling of optional vs required fields

### Relationship Management
- Bidirectional relationships properly configured
- Foreign key constraints with appropriate delete behavior
- Support for nullable relationships where business logic requires

## Files Modified/Created
1. `src/modules/user/entities/user.entity.ts` - Enhanced with validation and relationships
2. `src/modules/department/entities/department.entity.ts` - Enhanced with validation and constraints
3. `src/modules/user/entities/user.entity.spec.ts` - Comprehensive test suite
4. `src/modules/department/entities/department.entity.spec.ts` - Comprehensive test suite
5. `package.json` - Added class-validator and class-transformer dependencies

## Verification
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Application builds successfully
- ✅ Database schema creation verified through application startup
- ✅ TypeORM entity metadata properly recognized
- ✅ Relationships and constraints properly configured

## Next Steps
The entities are now ready for use in services and controllers. The validation decorators will work automatically with NestJS validation pipes when used in DTOs and controller endpoints.
