# Task 3 Implementation Summary: Core Attendance Services

## Overview
Task 3 has been successfully implemented, providing comprehensive core attendance services with clock-in/out functionality and session management. All required features have been developed according to the specifications.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Clock-In Method ✅
- **Location Validation**: Integrated with GeospatialService to validate user location against authorized entities
- **Entity Assignment**: Automatically assigns the nearest authorized entity to the attendance record
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents multiple clock-ins on the same date
- **Fraud Detection**: Analyzes clock-in location for suspicious patterns
- **Implementation**: `AttendanceService.clockIn()`

### 2. Clock-Out Method ✅
- **Travel Speed Calculation**: Calculates travel speed from clock-in to clock-out location
- **Total Hours Calculation**: Automatically calculates total work hours
- **Session Validation**: Ensures no active sessions exist before allowing clock-out
- **Fraud Analysis**: Flags records with impossible travel speeds (>200 km/h)
- **Implementation**: `AttendanceService.clockOut()`

### 3. Session Check-In Method ✅
- **Location Validation**: Validates session location within entity radius
- **Session Type Support**: Supports work, break, lunch, meeting, errand session types
- **Daily Attendance Requirement**: Requires active daily attendance before session start
- **Overlap Prevention**: Prevents multiple active sessions simultaneously
- **Implementation**: `AttendanceService.sessionCheckIn()`

### 4. Session Check-Out Method ✅
- **Duration Calculation**: Calculates session duration in minutes
- **Travel Speed Analysis**: Analyzes travel between session locations
- **Fraud Detection**: Flags suspicious travel patterns between sessions
- **Active Session Validation**: Ensures active session exists before check-out
- **Implementation**: `AttendanceService.sessionCheckOut()`

### 5. Validation Logic ✅
- **Duplicate Clock-In Prevention**: Throws ConflictException for duplicate attempts
- **Invalid Clock-Out Prevention**: Validates clock-in exists before clock-out
- **Session Overlap Prevention**: Prevents overlapping session check-ins
- **Daily Attendance Requirement**: Enforces daily attendance for all session operations

### 6. Geospatial Integration ✅
- **Location Validation**: Full integration with GeospatialService
- **Distance Calculations**: Haversine formula for accurate distance measurement
- **Entity Access Resolution**: Combines user-specific and department-based assignments
- **Radius Validation**: Validates locations within entity radius requirements

### 7. Fraud Detection Integration ✅
- **Travel Speed Analysis**: Integrated fraud detection for all location changes
- **Suspicious Activity Flagging**: Automatic flagging of records exceeding 200 km/h
- **Pattern Analysis**: Analyzes travel patterns between different locations
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging of fraud detection reasons

### 8. Query Methods ✅
- **Today's Attendance**: `getTodayAttendance()` - Get current day attendance
- **Attendance History**: `getUserAttendanceHistory()` - Get date range history
- **Active Session**: `getCurrentSession()` - Get current active session
- **Active Location Log**: `getCurrentLocationLog()` - Get current location check-in
- **Attendance by Date**: `getAttendanceByDate()` - Get specific date attendance

## API Endpoints Implemented
