- `validateUserEntityIntegrity()`: Referential integrity validation

### 4. Enhanced Exception Handling
**File**: `src/common/exceptions/business-logic.exceptions.ts`

**New Exception Classes**:
- `AttendanceStateException`: Handles invalid attendance state transitions with suggestions
- `FraudDetectionException`: Specialized fraud detection error handling
- `ConcurrentOperationException`: Manages concurrent operation conflicts
- `ReferentialIntegrityException`: Database relationship validation errors

### 5. Enhanced Global Exception Filter
**File**: `src/common/filters/global-exception.filter.ts`

**Improvements**:
- **Attendance-Specific Constraints**: Enhanced database error handling for attendance operations
