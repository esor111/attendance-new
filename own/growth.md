✅ Want to implement role-permission based approach
✅ Need flexibility for different roles having different permissions on entities
✅ Looking for comprehensive implementation guidance

really lets brain strome is this handle this sinaro

suppose we have have entites and we give diffrent permission to the same role for e.g hotel(manager) havev diffrent permssion techcompany(manager) have diffrent permission
----
✅ Need entity-specific permissions for same role
✅ Example: Hotel Manager vs Tech Company Manager having different permissions
✅ Want to brainstorm how to handle this scenario
-------------
better:

I need entity-specific role permissions where:
- Same role (Manager) has different permissions in different entities
- Hotel Manager: [room management, guest services, housekeeping]
- Tech Manager: [code reviews, deployments, team planning]
- Behavior: [inherit + add, or completely override base permissions]
- Conflict resolution: [entity-specific wins, or explicit priority system]
------------

we have updated table enities relations node and so on So far

i want you to scan the codebae see all the entites and relations

and create a new dbml file take a referance form database-diagram.dbml
----
✅ Need to scan codebase for all entities and relationships
✅ Update the existing DBML file with current structure
✅ Use existing database-diagram.dbml as reference

what is the exact taks we are doing before what is the context you have last conversation
